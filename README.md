# Kickstarting with Excel

## Overview of Project
Due to the success of Louise’s play, Fever, in nearly reaching its fundraising goal in a short period of time, we will analyze how other campaigns performed in reaching their funding goals in relation to their launch dates.	

## Analysis and Challenges
Leveraging the Kickstarter dataset, which breaks each campaign out by outcomes, goals and dates, I was able to use the date associated with the creation of each campaign to analyze how the launch date of a campaign can impact a Play’s outcome from a performance perspective.
### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Launch Date
Reviewing 8 years’ worth of data and performing analysis, we’ve determined that while May has the most plays launched by month, it also has the highest success rate at 66.87%. Reviewing the months with the lowest number of launch dates, January, March, September, and December, they also shows the lowest success rates.
### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Goals
Leveraging the same Kickstarter data, I was able to determine that the most successful campaigns had goals >$5000 or between $35k and $45k. The worst performing campaigns occurred when goals exceeded $45k. 
### Challenges and Difficulties Encountered
No real issues were discovered during this challenge. I can see where people may run into issues when manipulating the data to properly perform the various aspects of analysis. 
## Results
- What are two conclusions you can draw about the Outcomes based on Launch Date?
While May has the most plays launched by month, it also has the highest success rate at 66.87%. Reviewing the months with the lowest number of launch dates, January, March, September, and December, they also show the lowest success rates.
- What can you conclude about the Outcomes based on Goals?
The most successful campaigns had goals >$5000 or between $35k and $45k. The worst performing campaigns occurred when goals exceeded $45k.
- What are some limitations of this dataset?
The dataset only presents beginning and ending campaign dates. It’d be great to show the pledging occur over time to better understand where/when campaigns lose their momentum.
- What are some other possible tables and/or graphs that we could create?
Similar to measuring Plays, it'd be great to see a breakdown by Parent categories. Comparing the various categories we can potentially see how the campaigns pan out in different spaces.
